# Open Remote.vim

**open-remote** is a Neovim plugin to open the current file in your VCS
    web UI (i.e. GitHub.com).

Currently, only works with [Sapling](https://github.com/facebook/sapling).  Git
support coming ðŸ”œ

Inspired by [ruanyl/vim-gh-line](https://github.com/ruanyl/vim-gh-line)

## Installation
### manual
1. clone this repo into your runtimepath (e.g. `~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/external/start/`)

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/external/start/
$ clone ssh://git@github.com/vegerot/open-remote ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/external/start/open-remote
```

2. Add a shortcut for this command in your `init.vim`:

```vim
nmap <leader>op :OpenFile
vmap <leader>op :OpenFile "for selecting ranges of lines
nmap <leader>cp :CopyFile
vmap <leader>cp :CopyFile "for selecting ranges of lines
```

### vim-plug
1. Install vim-plug
2. add to your plugins in `init.vim`

```vim
Plug 'vegerot/open-remote'
```



## Developing
```sh
$ nvim open-remote.lua
" run tests
:w | source % | OpenRemoteTest
" no output = âœ…
```

to develop open-remote, you can quickly iterate by
```sh
$ nvim open-remote.lua
" make some change
:w | source %
:OpenRepo
" web browser should open to https://github.com/vegerot/dotfiles (or wherever you put this file)
```

## TODO
(in approximately the order of priority)
- [x] add `CopyFile` (which copies the URL) (landed in 5cc1dc0e8)
- [x] support ranges (can visual select multiple lines and open that range) (landed in 9d6d497a)
- [ ] detect if `ref` is pushed to remote.  If not, then find the most recent
  ref/branch that has been pushed and use that instead
	- when ref is not pushed to remote, detect if the lines you are trying to
	  open are different on remote.  If so, log a warning like "warning: the
	  lines you are trying to open are different on remote"
- [ ] support git
- [ ] choose remote
- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] customize how to open browser (e.g. default browser)
- [ ] `OpenBlame`

## Better project names
- OpenTheSource
- ForkShare
